In August of 1993 my father was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He chose not to receive chemotherapy 
treatments so that he could live out the rest of his life in dignity. About a week before his death, we asked Dad 
if he would play the mandolin for us. He made excuses but said "okay". He knew it would probably be the last time he
would play for us. He tuned up the old mandolin and played a few notes. When I looked around, there was not a dry eye 
in the family. We saw before us a quiet humble man with an inner strength that comes from knowing God, and living with
him in one's life. Dad would never play the mandolin for us again. We felt at the time that he wouldn't have enough 
strength to play, and that makes the memory of that day even stronger. Dad was doing something he had done all his 
life, giving. As sick as he was, he was still pleasing others. Dad sure could play that Mandolin!Floating Amidst The Stars Stargazing Meditation Since the beginning of time, humans have gazed at the stars in 
the night sky with awe, seeking in their luminosity everything from answers to inspiration to guidance. We have emerged
from our contemplations with stories of gods and goddesses, maps of the universe, astrology, astronomy, math, and art.
We have worshipped, wondered, and even projected ourselves out into space in an attempt to understand their magical 
essence. We know more now than we ever have about what those celestial lights are, how far away they reside, and what
will happen to them over time, but facts and information are still no substitute for experiencing them yourself. Gazing
at the stars is no doubt one of the earliest forms of meditation practiced by human beings, and it is readily 
available to this day. If you live in a city, you may have a hard time seeing the stars, but a short drive can take
you far enough beyond the city lights to reveal their glory. If you live in a rural setting, all you have to do is
wait for the sun to set and the night to settle to get the show of your life, every night. If you make a habit of it,
you will begin to know the seasonal changes of the night sky, deepening your connection to the earth and the universe
in which you live. One of the best ways to stargaze is to lie down on a blanket so that your body can fully relax. 
This position allows your breath to move easily through your tranquil form as you settle down into the earth, 
connecting your consciousness to the sky. As you look deeply into its vastness, allowing your awareness to alternate 
between the pinpoints of light and the blue-black space that holds them, your breath expands and contracts your body, 
just as the universe expands and contracts to its own eternal rhythm. You may feel as if you are floating amidst the 
stars or that they are raining down upon you. You may feel peacefulness, joy, and connectedness, or any of a full 
range of emotions. Simply continue to breathe, experiencing the wonder of this universe and your place within it.

My father was a self-taught mandolin player. He was one of the best string instrument players in our town. 
He could not read music, but if he heard a tune a few times, he could play it. When he was younger, he was a
member of a small country music band. They would play at local dances and on a few occasions would play for the
local radio station. He often told us how he had auditioned and earned a position in a band that featured Patsy 
as their lead singer. He told the family that after he was hired he never went back. Dad was a very religious man.
He stated that there was a lot of drinking and cursing the day of his audition and he did not want to be around that
type of environment.

Occasionally, Dad would get out his mandolin and play for the family. We three children: Trisha, Monte and I, 
George Jr., would often sing along. Songs such as the Tennessee Waltz, Harbor Lights and around Christmas time, 
the well-known rendition of Silver Bells. "Silver Bells, Silver Bells, its Christmas time in the city" would ring
throughout the house. One of Dad's favorite hymns was "The Old Rugged Cross". We learned the words to the hymn when 
we were very young, and would sing it with Dad when he would play and sing. Another song that was often shared in our
house was a song that accompanied the Walt Disney series: Davey Crockett. Dad only had to hear the song twice before
he learned it well enough to play it. "Davey, Davey Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier" was a favorite song for the
family. He knew we enjoyed the song and the program and would often get out the mandolin after the program was over.
I could never get over how he could play the songs so well after only hearing them a few times. I loved to sing,
but I never learned how to play the mandolin. This is something I regret to this day.

Dad loved to play the mandolin for his family he knew we enjoyed singing, and hearing him play. He was like that.
If he could give pleasure to others, he would, especially his family. He was always there, sacrificing his time and
efforts to see that his family had enough in their life. I had to mature into a man and have children of my own
before I realized how much he had sacrificed.

I joined the United States Air Force in January of 1962. Whenever I would come home on leave, I would ask Dad to play
the mandolin. Nobody played the mandolin like my father. He could touch your soul with the tones that came out of
that old mandolin. He seemed to shine when he was playing. You could see his pride in his ability to play so well
for his family.

When Dad was younger, he worked for his father on the farm. His father was a farmer and sharecropped a farm for the
man who owned the property. In 1950, our family moved from the farm. Dad had gained employment at the local limestone 
quarry. When the quarry closed in August of 1957, he had to seek other employment. He worked for Owens Yacht Company
in Dundalk, Maryland and for Todd Steel in Point of Rocks, Maryland. While working at Todd Steel, he was involved in 
an accident. His job was to roll angle iron onto a conveyor so that the welders farther up the production line would
have it to complete their job. On this particular day Dad got the third index finger of his left hand mashed between 
two pieces of steel. The doctor who operated on the finger could not save it, and Dad ended up having the tip of the
finger amputated. He didn't lose enough of the finger where it would stop him picking up anything, but it did impact
his ability to play the mandolin.

After the accident, Dad was reluctant to play the mandolin. He felt that he could not play as well as he had before 
the accident. When I came home on leave and asked him to play he would make excuses for why he couldn't play. 
Eventually, we would wear him down and he would say "Okay, but remember, I can't hold down on the strings the way I
used to" or "Since the accident to this finger I can't play as good". For the family it didn't make any difference
that Dad couldn't play as well. We were just glad that he would play. When he played the old mandolin it would carry 
us back to a cheerful, happier time in our lives. "Davey, Davey Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier", would again be 
heard in the little town of Bakerton, West Virginia.

We'd like to share some of the positive meanings love has for us. 
 Love means that I know the person I love. I'm aware of the many sides of the other person - not just the beautiful side but also the limitations, inconsistencies and faults. I have an awareness of the other's feelings and thoughts, and I experience something of the core of that person. I can penetrate social masks and roles and see the other person on a deeper level. 
 Love means that I care about the welfare of the person I love. To the extent that it is genuine, my caring is not possessive, nor does it hold the other person back. On the contrary, my caring frees both of us. If I care about you, I'm concerned about your growth, and I hope you will become all that you can become. Consequently, I don't put up obstacles to what you do that enhances you as a person, even though it may result in my discomfort at times. 
 Love means having respect for the dignity of the person I love. If I love you, I can see you as a separate person, with your own values and thoughts and feelings, and I do not insist that you surrender your identity to match an image of what I expect you to be for me. I can allow and encourage you to stand alone and to be who you are, and I avoid treating you as an object or using you primarily to satisfy my own needs. 
 Love means having a responsibility toward the person I love. If I love you, I respond to most of your major needs as a person. This responsibility does not include my doing for you what you are capable of doing for yourself; nor does it mean that I run your life for you. It does mean acknowledging that what I am and what I do affects you, so that I am directly involved in your happiness and your suffering. A lover does have the capacity to hurt or ignore the loved one, and in this sense we see that love involves an acceptance of some responsibility for the impact my way of being has on you. 
 Love means making a commitment to the person I love. This commitment does not mean surrendering our total selves to each other; nor does it imply that the relationship is necessarily permanent. It does involve a willingness to stay with each other in times of pain, struggle, and despair, as well as in times of calm and enjoyment. 
 Love means trusting the person I love. If I love you, I trust that you will accept my caring and my love and that you won't deliberately hurt me. I trust that you will find me attractive, and that you won't abandon me; I trust the mutual nature of our love. If we trust each other, we are willing to be open to each other and reveal our true selves. 
 Love can tolerate imperfection. In a love relationship there are times when I am bored, times when I may feel like giving up, times of real strain, and times I feel I can't move forward. Authentic love does not imply enduring happiness. I can stay during rough times, however, because I can remember what we had together in the past, and I can picture what we will have together in our future if we care enough to face our problems and work them through. We agree with the idea that love is a spirit that changes life. Love is a way of life that is creative and that transforms. However, love is not reserved for a perfect world. Love is meant for our imperfect world where things go wrong. Love is meant to be a spirit that works in painful situations. Love is meant to bring meaning into life where nonsense appears to rule. In other words, love comes into an imperfect world to make it possible to live. 
 Love is open. If I love you, I encourage you to reach out and develop other relationships. Although our love for each other and our commitment to each other might prohibit certain actions on our parts, we are not totally and exclusively married to each other. It is a false love that cements one person to another in such a way that he or she is not given room to grow. 
 Love is selfish. I can only love you if I genuinely love, value, appreciate, and respect myself. If I am empty, then all I can give you is my emptiness. If I feel that I'm complete and worthwhile in myself, then I'm able to give to you out of my fullness. One of the best ways for me to give you love is by fully enjoying myself with you. 
 Love involves seeing the potential within the person we love. In my love for another, I view her or him as the person she or he can become, while still accepting who and what the person is now. By taking people as they are, we make them worse, but by treating them as if they already were what they ought to be, we help make them better. 
 To sum it up, mature love is union under the condition of preserving one's individuality. In love, two beings become one and yet remain two.
